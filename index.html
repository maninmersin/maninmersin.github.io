            <p>In this eLearning module we will showing how users can learn new systems. Here we will be using an example of an Oracle based system called SIOCS. In this example the training activities are designed to provide a basic understanding and knowledge required to navigate around SIOCS.</p>
            <p>The activities are designed to be carried out in sequence.</p>

<ol>
<li>Overview - to give you an introduction on what you about to learn.</li>
<li>Demonstration - where you can learn by listening and watching a demonstration of tasks being performed.</li>
<li>Exercise - Here you will be tested on what you have just seen as part of the demo. You are instructed to complete the steps in a system simulation, for a particular task, and are scored on how accurately you complete the steps.</li>
<li>Quiz - Here you will asked some multiple choice questions to check your knowledge of the module.</li></ol>
